      <H1>Privacy Policy for Call Blocker</h1>
      <small>Last Updated: <time>July 19, 2025</time></small>
    </header>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how badiale.dev ("we," "us," or "our") handles information in connection with your use of the Call Blocker mobile application (the "App").</p>
    <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy. This App is designed with privacy in mind and aims to provide its functionality with minimal data access and absolutely no data collection or transmission.</p>
    <h2>1. Data We Access (But Do Not Collect, Store, or Transmit)</h2>
    <p>To function as a call blocker, the App requires the following permission:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Contacts (READ_CONTACTS):</b> The App may request access to your device's contact list. This access is <b>solely</b> for the purpose of allowing you to identify and select contacts for blocking or whitelisting directly within the App on your device.<br />
        <b>Important:</b> This contact data is <b>never</b> saved on your device by the App, processed beyond the immediate use for call blocking features, or transmitted to any server or third party. It is only accessed in real-time on your device to perform its intended function.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>2. No User Information Collection or Storage</h2>
    <p>We want to be absolutely clear:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>No Personal Data Collection:</b> The App does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data about you or your device to us or any third party. This includes, but is not limited to, your name, email address, phone number, device ID, IP address, location, or any other identifiable information.</li>
      <li><b>No Anonymous Data or Telemetry:</b> We do not use any analytics, telemetry, or crash reporting services that would transmit data about your usage patterns, device information, or any other anonymous statistics.</li>
      <li><b>No Third-Party Access:</b> No third parties have access to any information through our App because no information is collected or transmitted.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>3. How Information is Used</h2>
    <p>The limited access to your Contacts (as described above) is used exclusively on your device for the App's core functionality:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To compare incoming call numbers with your contact list to perform call blocking actions locally on your device.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>Since the App does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data, there is no risk of data breaches involving your personal information through our App. Your data remains entirely on your device, under your control.</p>
    <h2>5. Open Source Nature</h2>
    <p>Call Blocker is an open-source application. This means its source code is publicly available and can be reviewed by anyone. We believe this transparency further ensures that our privacy commitments are verifiable and that no hidden data collection occurs. You can find the source code at https://github.com/badiale/CallBlocker.</p>
    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our App does not collect any personal information, and therefore, it does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personal information from a child under 13 without verifiable parental consent, we will delete that information from our records.</p>
    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
