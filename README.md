# CallBlocker

This app works by looking at your contact list and blocking every call that you don't know.

## No complex algorithms to determine if a call is from a Spam/Scam.

Most of the blockers available today won't block things that should be a Spam/Scam because they are paid to unblock companies phones, and also show their business cards to you.
This would be well and good if there were not fake companies abusing this system, so they aren't blocked and can continue scamming people.

To solve this, no third party is used to classify if a phone is legitimate or not.
*YOU* are in the control.
Just add the phone numbers you trust in your contact list, and you are good to go.

When companies find out your phone number, it is only fair that they share theirs with you, if you want to receive their calls.
